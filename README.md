Make a folder In a Godot project named addons. Find the version of the visual tool that matches the version you use
currently 3.5 and 4.3 are the only ones officially supported and Unzip it in to that folder. 
It will throw a lot of errors. Don’t mind them just go into Project>Projectsettings>Plugins and Check the checkbox under status. 
Next you will have to close and reopen Godot. It should be running smoothly after that. (Don’t know why but, 
Following these steps seems to fix the random stuff godot gets mad about.)
